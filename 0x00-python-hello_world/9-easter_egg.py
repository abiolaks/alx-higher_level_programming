Simple is better than complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\n\
Flat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\n\
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\n\
In the face of ambiquity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n\
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n\
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're a Dutch.\n\

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!.");
